### NEW GAME RULES  

  
These rules are official and must be used in all official games (like tournaments).

**ALLIANCES (From the GOLGOTHA Expansion)  
**  
The seven Alliances are the cornerstones of the Mutant Chronicles universe, and most warriors belong to one of them. Players may openly state they wish to play one of the alliances, giving his or her warriors from that alliance a considerable bonus.

The EFFECT of each Alliance card is written on it. Alliance cards may be played AT ANY TIME. Each player may only have ONE ALLIANCE CARD IN PLAY. Alliance cards may NEVER BE DISCARDED, except by cards that specifically discard or otherwise remove Alliance cards from the game (for example HOSTILE TAKEOVER). All Alliance cards are UNIQUE; you may never play an Alliance card if there already is an identical Alliance card in play.

**ATTACKING A PLAYER DIRECTLY  
**  
In the basic rules a warrior is allowed to directly attack a player if that player has no warriors in play. Since then a few warriors who may not be in combat have been created (like APOSTLES and CORPORATE LEADERS). A common strategy was to stick one of these in play all by itself, thereby preventing another player from directly attacking you. This is now illegal.

A player may be directly attacked if he has no warriors in play THAT ARE ABLE TO BE IN COMBAT. This means that APOSTLES, CORPORATE LEADERS and warriors on SHORE LEAVE may NOT prevent a player from being directly attacked if they are the only warriors in play for that player.

An important distinction here is that this only means warriors who may not be in combat AT ALL. It does NOT mean that the warriors in play simply cannot attack one another. For example, if the only warrior I have in play is a Brotherhood warrior, and you just have Imperial warriors, you cannot directly attack me because the Brotherhood warrior is in the way. He may not be attacked by the Imperial warriors, but he is allowed to BE IN combat, whereas APOSTLES and the rest are not allowed to be in combat at all.

**COMBAT MODIFIERS**

You may now play any number of duplicate combat-modifying cards that you already played during a combat. The effects are cumulative. For example, you MAY play two or more POWERFUL BLOW cards on a combatant, each providing an additional +2 to F. Everyone was doing this anyway, so were making it official.

**HARMING YOUR OWN WARRIORS**

In the first-edition DOOMTROOPER basic rules we allowed players to attack their own warriors at will, and if the warrior was killed the player earned Destiny Points. While this was supposed to be used only as a desperation act to get much-needed Destiny Points, it was quickly abused.

We then changed the rule to say players could not directly attack their own warriors, but if they were forced to through Special card play, and that warrior was killed, then the player could earn either Promotion Points or Destiny Points.

Well, after so many expansions, this has also become a subject of abuse. With this rule in place, the best players were not fighting each other, they were destroying themselves. DOOMTROOPER is a game of interaction and slugging it out for domination, and its time to force that interaction upon you.

You may still force your warriors to attack your warriors (through Special card play and Art spells, etc.) but in the event that your warrior does end up in combat against another of your warriors, and either or both of your warriors is killed, you earn only Destiny Points. In other words, you NEVER get Promotion Points for killing your own warriors. This includes killing your warriors at the expense of the enemy. For example, if you play WIND OF INSANITY and kill your own warriors in the process, you dont earn any Promotion Points for them, just Destiny Points.

**MORTIFICATORS**

Any card that is considered a MORTIFICATOR may attack any other warrior in play, regardless of affiliation, even other Brotherhood warriors.

**RELICS (From the INQUISITION Expansion)**

Relics are ancient artifacts of great power. Originally, Relic cards could only be played if you had previously played a NOTED COLLECTOR card. This is hereby changed; you do NOT need to be a NOTED COLLECTOR in order to put a Relic card into play. Instead, all Relic cards go under the following rules:

* Relic cards are attached to your warriors as one action each.
* All Relic cards are UNIQUE; you may never play a Relic card if there already is an identical Relic card in play. Copies of discarded Relics may enter play again later.
* Relics are not considered Equipment.

**SERGEANTS**

The biggest source of confusion in the WARZONE expansion is with the various Sergeants - anything designated as COMMANDER (SERGEANT). Here is a sample of the numerous questions I have received:

_May I assign a Sergeant to another Sergeant?  
May I assign multiple Sergeants to the same warrior?  
Do I have to assign the Sergeant as soon as he is put into play, or can I wait?  
Do you compare base V or modified V?  
_  
And so on. Ill be honest, we didnt give these guys enough thought (due to various limitations we had to alter them at the last minute). We certainly didnt think they would cause this much trouble. Well, we were wrong. Here are a few rules to help you deal with Sergeants.

1) Only warriors with BASE Values LOWER THAN the BASE Value of the Sergeant may be assigned to the Sergeant. This means that the only numbers you compare are the Values printed on the warrior cards. Do NOT take V modifiers into account, even if the modified V of the assigned warrior is equal to or higher than its Sergeant. The reason is that Value is not equivalent to rank, it is a measure of the individuals worth on the battlefield. As everyone knows, the lowliest private may be more worthwhile than any high-ranking goon in the thick of battle! This leads to a few assumptions:

* Sergeants may not be assigned to other Sergeants.  
* A lowly SEA LION with a ton of V enhancers may be assigned to a Sergeant.  
* You dont have to worry if some warriors have higher or lower modified Vs than others.

2) A warrior card group (for example, the SEA LIONS, the CLANSMEN, the FREE MARINES, the BAUHAUS BLITZERS, etc.) may only have one Sergeant assigned to it.

3) If a warrior groups Sergeant is killed, they may have another Sergeant assigned to it.

4) If the last of the assigned warrior group is killed, the Sergeant may be re-assigned to a different warrior group.

5) Once a Sergeant is assigned to a warrior group, the assignment is permanent while both the group members and the Sergeant are in play.

6) You do NOT have to assign the Sergeant to a warrior group when he is played. You may assign the Sergeant at any time (even during combat). Once assigned, the Sergeant is stuck with that group, and they are stuck with him!

7) If the Sergeant loses its Corporate affiliation, the assignment is broken. Likewise, if the last of the assigned warriors loses its affiliation, the assignment is broken. Remember that many times when a Corporate warrior is turned into a Heretic, he still keeps his Corporate affiliation (he becomes a spy!).

**VEHICLES IN DOOMTROOPER**

There are a number of different vehicles: straight VEHICLES, AIRSHIPS, SUBMARINES and TANKS. All VEHICLES are pretty much the same as far as game rules go, and here are some clarifications when it comes to VEHICLES:

Warriors are equipped with VEHICLES just like any other equipment. A warrior may only be equipped with one VEHICLE. Usually (but not always) a VEHICLE restricts the use of other equipment. If a Vehicle does not say that it restrics equipment, then equipment may be used. Often this restriction is in the form of weapons. If the VEHICLE restricts Equipment, it restricts all Equipment cards; if it restricts WEAPONS, then only WEAPONS are restricted, and ARMOR and other equipment is OK to use.

ENTERING AND EXITING VEHICLES

A warrior with a Vehicle must be either INSIDE or OUTSIDE of its Vehicle. To signify that a warrior is OUTSIDE a Vehicle (thereby unable to use it or gain its effects), place it FACE-DOWN on the table next to the warrior. To signify that a warrior is INSIDE a Vehicle, place the Vehicle FACE-UP on the table next to the warrior. A warrior may Enter and Exit its Vehicle as many times it wants during a turn, BUT EACH TIME IT ENTERS OR EXITS YOU MUST USE ONE ACTION. When you Enter/Exit the Vehicle, simply flip the Vehicle card over.

* When a warrior first is equipped with a vehicle, the player must announce if the warrior is INSIDE or OUTSIDE the Vehicle, and place the Vehicle accordingly. If you choose to have the warrior initially OUTSIDE the Vehivcle, you must still show it to your opponents, so they know it is a Vehicle. Placing the warrior INSIDE the Vehicle does not cost an additional action.
* An important thing to remember is that since warriors in Cover are not allowed to be in Vehicles (see below), if you give a Vehilce to a warrior in cover it MUST be OUTSIDE (and you STILL must show it to your opponents, as noted above).
* A warrior may only gain the benefits of a Vehicle when it is INSIDE the Vehicle.
* If the warrior is INSIDE its Vehicle and the Vehicle is discarded, the warrior is WOUNDED (no points are earned if the warrior is killed). If the warrior is OUTSIDE its Vehicle and the Vehicle is discarded, the warrior is not affected.
* Of course, card texts take precedence!
* And what about the KLEIN HELITEK DRAGONFLY and the REAVER TROOP CARRIER? Because these cards are placed directly in a Squad/Kohort (and not given to individual warriors) they are always face-up. Just like above, warriors spend actions entering and exiting these Vehicles.

(* Here is an OPTIONAL rule for this rule (but one this is much more radical). A warrior may now HAVE as many Vehicles as you wish, but it may only be INSIDE one at a time. Remember, it will take two actions to exit one Vehicle and enter another! *)
* If the warrior is OUTSIDE the VEHICLE, it may use other equipment with no restrictions, including weapons. The warrior is still considered to have possession of the VEHICLE.
* If the warrior is INSIDE the VEHICLE, the following things are enacted:

a) The warrior may not gain the benefits of fortifications.  
b) Opponents of the warrior may gain the benefits of their fortifications.  
c) The warrior may not Seek Cover. A warrior in cover may not Enter the VEHICLE, and must Exit Cover before Entering the VEHICLE again. If the warrior in forced into cover through card play, the warrior is forced out of its Vehicle as well.

* A warrior inside an AIRSHIP or a SUBMARINE may NOT attack or BE ATTACKED by another warrior with a FIGHT combat. If a warrior with an AIRSHIP or SUBMARINE wishes to attack another by Fighting, it must first Exit the AIRSHIP or SUBMARINE. Straight VEHICLES and TANKS are not affected in this way.

**WARZONES (From the WARZONE Expansion)  
**  
Warzones are raging battlefields in the Mutant Chronicles Universe. Originally, Warzone cards could only be played if you had previously played a GRAND TACTICIAN card. This is hereby changed; you do NOT need to be a GRAND TACTICIAN in order to put a Warzone card into play. Instead, all Warzone cards go under the following rules:

* Warzone cards are added to your Squad/Kohort as one action each.
* Any number of identical Warzones may be in play., even in your own Squad/Kohort.
* When your warrior is the Defender in a combat, that warrior may choose to defend from one of the Warzones in its Squad/Kohort.
* During the combat, the Defender gains the effects and modifiers to F, S, A and V listed on the Warzone card. The attackers F, S, A and V are not modified.
* If you defend from a Warzone, NEITHER combatant may use effects from Fortification cards. Equipment and warriors that are considered Fortifications may be used.
* When attacking, you may not use your Warzones. Your Squad members may not use your KohortÔs Warzones and vice versa.

Here are some more important things to remember about Warzones.

1) The defending player announces if his or her warrior will Defend from a Warzone AFTER the Battle Tactic is announced (see THE MOTHER OF ALL COMBAT BREAKDOWNS, below).

2) Only the Defender gains the F, S A and V modifiers listed on the Warzone card, but all combatants are affected by the text on the card.
