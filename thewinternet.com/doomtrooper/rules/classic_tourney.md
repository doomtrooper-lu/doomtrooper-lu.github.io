### TOURNAMENT RULES

Updated 4/28/97

**Tournament Officials**

All official tournaments must have a Head Judge who may be assisted by one or more Assistant Referees. None of the Tournament Officials may participate in the tournament. Judges may have to interpret rules, terminate a game that has gone over the time limit or any other adjuration during the tournament. The Head Judge is responsible for reporting results to the sponsor.

Tournament officials have every right to change these tournament rules to suit their tournament needs. The officials are expected to announce all changes an ample amount of time before the tournament begins (preferably on announcements and during signup). Major changes should be approved by Target Games AB (e-mail: [doomtrooper@target.se][1]).

**Card Protection**

Plastic sleeves and other protection for cards are allowed as long as the Head Judge and all players participating in the game permit it and that every card in the deck has identical protection so as no card will be marked.

**Rules**

All rules from the most current edition of the basic set of Doomtrooper apply unless overuled by the latest FAQ, information cards (found in recent expansions) or these tournament rules. The latest FAQ and information card texts can be found at this Web site. Card Errata is listed at the end of this document.

Treat all cards as if they have the card text and Combat ratings from the most current edition of the basic set.

Once used, the following cards are annihilated (removed entirely from the game instead of simply discarded):

BOGGED DOWN (DT)  
EXPEDITE REQUEST (DT)  
GIFT OF FATE (DT)  
GREATER DIVINATION (INQ)  
GREATER DOMINATION (DT)  
GUSTS OF HESITATION (INQ)  
HIDDEN CACHE (INQ)  
LESSER DOMINATION (DT)  
NATHANIELS OPPORTUNITY (INQ)  
RETRAINING (DT)  
RUTHLESS EFFICIENCY (DT)  
SCROLL OF UNHOLY INVOCATION (INQ)  
STORM OF CHAOS (INQ)  
SUPPLY LINE SEVERED (INQ)  

Cards that are annihilated may not return to the game by any means, except by playing the card A SECOND CHANCE (APOC).

Cards that may not/never be discarded may always be annihilated, unless the card specifically states otherwise.

A player may only play BLOOD LUST (DT) once during each of his turns.

For cards which allow a player to pull cards from his collection, a collection is defined as the players draw pile, discard pile, hand and Side Bar. Cards in play or annihilated may not be taken.

A player may only give Equipment, Relic, Dark Symmetry and Mission cards to his own warriors. Exceptions are cards that may be given to any warrior or player (which may be given to any warrior in play), and cards which state specifically otherwise.

All discards are made with the cards face down. No other player may see which card a player discard. A player is always permitted to look through his own discard pile.

**The Cardinals Gift**

If a player **does not** have any warrior in his opening hand of seven cards may claim the Cardinals Gift. He must show his hand to the Referee (not the other players) and pick seven new cards. The first seven cards are then shuffled back into the playing deck.

A player that **does** have a warrior in his opening hand may also claim the Cardinals Gift, but in this case the first seven cards are not shuffled back into the playing deck. Instead, they become the first seven cards of the players discard pile.

The Cardinals Gift may only be claimed after opening draw, and may only be claimed once by each player.

**Beginning and Winning**

Decide by lot which player begins.

The game begins when the first player either performs his or her first action, or plays a "play at any time" card. Other players may not play "play at any time" cards before the very first player has had a chance to do something.

During initial multiplayer rounds, the first player to reach 25 Promotion Points is the winner. During two-player rounds, semifinals and finals, the first player to reach 40 Promotion points is the winner.

In case of a tie, the players who are tied continue playing until one has earned 10 more Promotion Points. Continue in this manner until there is a clear winner.

If a player is unable to draw a card because there are no more cards in his draw pile, the game continues exactly as stated under STEP ONE: DRAW in the basic rulebook.

**Time Limit**

Time Limit for each game is decided by the organizer of the tournament. Rule questions and other instances involving tournament official interaction stops the clock. Semi-finals and the final games should never be terminated because of overtime.

Players should be warned when there are 15, 10 and 5 minutes remaining. If a game is not completed by the decided time limits, the game immediately ends after the current players turn and the player with the most Promotion Points wins. In the event of a tie, the tied player with the most warriors in play is declared the winner (DOUBLE DUTY warriors do not count). If the tied players have an equal number of warriors in play, the tied players continue playing until each has completed three more full turns.

**Collection, Playing Deck and Side Bar**

Before the tournament begins, each player must present a list with all the cards in his Collection to the Referee. The Collection must consist of at least 60 cards (no upper limit).

The Collection must be divided into a Playing Deck (at least 60 cards; no upper limit) and a Side Bar (**exactly** 25 cards). If you dont wish to have a Side Bar, your entire Collection is your Playing Deck, and must remain your Playing Deck throughout the tournament.

All participating players must have at least 5 warriors in their Playing Deck.

You may change the composition of your Playing Deck and the Side Bar between games, but you may not change the composition of your Collection during the course of a tournament. Your Side Bar must **always** contain **exactly** 25 cards at the start of each game (if you have one).

All cards in your collection must consist of cards from the same language edition, i.e. its not allowed to mix for example English and French cards.

**Collection Contruction**  
The number of copies of each card in your **collection** is mandated by the following allowances, in this order:

1) Banned cards may not be used at all.  
2) 2) Restricted cards are limited to 1 copy **per collection**.  
3) 3) Limits imposed by card texts.  
4) 4) All other cards are limited to 5 copies **per collection**.

**Head-to-Head Game (2 players)**

As noted in the restricted/banned list: BOGGED DOWN, RUTHLESS EFFICIENCY and LIMITED RESOURCES are banned in Head-to-Head games.

Otherwise no changes from the general rules.

**Free for All Game (3-6 players)**

No changes from the general rules.

**Team Game**

As noted in the restricted/banned list: LIMITED RESOURCES is banned in 2-team games. In game with 3 or more teams, it is only restricted.

Each PLAYER has his own personal Destiny Pool, but each TEAM has one common Promotion Point Pool.

Squads and Kohorts are extended to the other players in a team. For example, if one player in a team places a CATHEDRAL in his Squad, it effects the other players Squads as well. The other players warriors are NOT considered "your" warriors (for example, Equipment and Dark Symmetry cards may not be played on the team players warriors).

Example Seating (3-Team game)  
Before the game, number the teams from #1 to #3 (decide by lot).  
The players should be seated around the table in the following order:

Position 1: Player #1, Team #1  
Position 2: Player #1, Team #2  
Position 3: Player #1, Team #3  
Position 4: Player #2, Team #1  
Position 5: Player #2, Team #2  
Position 6: Player #2, Team #3  

so that the players in the same team are seated opposite to each other at the table.

The players in each team decide which player in the team that is Player #1 and which player that is Player #2. This may be changed until one player in the team has been seated, but once seated, this may not be changed.

Otherwise no changes from the general rules.

**CARD ERRATA**

See the [Card Errata][2] page.

**TOURNAMENT VARIANTS**  
**  
**Here are a number of variant rules to use when conducting tournaments. Be advised that NONE of these variants are considered "official" games. Only the rules above are considered "official" Doomtrooper games. Still, these variants do add a lot of fun twists to the game. Feel free to mix and match these ideas, and invent your own. If you are organizing a tournament, only hold variant games IN ADDITION to a standard tournament.

**3-CARD LIMIT**  
The best "just for fun variant. Instead of a limit of 5 copies of an individual card per deck, the limit changes to 3. Keep the current Restricted/Banned lists, eliminate them altogether, or change them as you see fit (be sure to announce this decision). Also works well if warriors with a Value of 4 or less are limited to 6 copies instead of 3. This variant also works very well with a deck limit of 80 total cards instead of 60.

**1-CARD LIMIT**  
Only one copy of a card is permitted in a deck. No Restricted or Banned cards.

**TOTAL CHAOS****  
**No Restricted or Banned cards.

**80-CARD DECKS**  
Instead of a limit of 60 cards in a deck, the minimum card count of a deck is 80.

**30-CARD DECKS**  
Just the opposite. The minimum card count of a deck is 30. Promotion Points required to win should be reduced to 25 (at the most). A fast variant! 20-card decks are another option.

**2nd CORPORATE WAR**  
No cards allowed with the Brotherhood or Dark Legion.

**ALL-COMMON**  
Only Common cards allowed. All cards from the GOLGOTHA and APOCALYPSE expansions are allowed (as they are all "Common").

**SEALED DECK**  
Each player receives 1 Starter deck, and 1 Booster pack from each expansion (or whatever is available). Each participant plays a number of games, each game against a new opponent. Keep track of total Promotion Points earned by each player (even if a player lost). Winner is the player with the most Promotion Points earned after all games. Perfect tournament for beginners. Also very good for Free For All games.

**BOOSTER DRAFT**  
Each player brings a number of unopened Booster packs to the game (each player should bring an equal number of packs per expansion). Players sit around the table. Each player simultaneously opens one Booster pack (from the same set/expansion). Each player takes a SINGLE card from the pack and passes the rest to the left. Players continue taking one card and passing the rest until there are no more cards in the pack. Then each player takes a new Booster, opens it, chooses a single card, passes it, and continues in this fashion until there are no more Booster packs to open and pass around. Players then use the cards they have chosen to create 40-card decks (all the rest are placed in the Side Board). And extremely fun variant which requires a lot of forethought! Best method is for each player to bring one Booster pack from the basic set and each expansion and open them in chronological order.

**PYRAMID OF POWER**  
This variant provides a "variable" card limit for warriors based on their Value. You may have as many copies of a warrior in your deck as their Value may be evenly divisible into 30 (or whatever number your choose). For example, ALAKHAI has a Value of 12, and 12 goes evenly into 30 twice, so you may have 2 ALAKHAIs in your deck. However, you can put up to 15 INFANTRY (V: 2) and 30 EX-[Corp] FREELANCERs (V: 1). The perfect variant for "Weenie Madness" tournaments.
